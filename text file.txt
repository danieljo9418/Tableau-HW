A text or markdown file with your analysis on the phenomenons you uncovered from the data.

The data used was the March 2020 CitiBike dataset from the Citi Bike Data website. Reviewing the dataset, I have 
noticed that the average time spent but customers is higher than our subscribers who pay a subscription. I was 
wondering, does that mean we have more customers than subscribers? So I have made a visualization and noticed that 
even though customers use the bikes longer, there are more subscribers significantly. I even broke down the genders 
of the customers and subscribers and noticed that in both categories, females used the bikes longer but there are 
more males in both categories. 

Then I wonder what is the age range that are using the bikes. I have noticed that the customers range were mostly
in the 23 to 33 range while the subscribers were a bit higher, ranging from 24 to 40 age group. 

So in conclusion, even though we have customers who are using the bikes longer, we have significantly larger amount 
of subscribers versus one time use customers.
